<h2><a name="System_Requirements"></a>System Requirements</h2>
      
<p>This section details the system requirements for installing and operating the Catalog Tool.
      </p>

      <section>
<h3><a name="Java_Runtime_Environment"></a>Java Runtime Environment</h3>
        
<p>The Catalog Tool was developed using Java and will run on any platform with a supported Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The software was specifically compiled for and tested in Java version 1.8. The following commands test the local Java installation in a UNIX-based environment:
        </p>

        
<div class="source">
<pre>
% which java
/usr/bin/java

% java -version
java version &quot;1.8.0_101&quot;
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_101-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.101-b13, mixed mode)
        </pre></div>

        
<p>The first command above checks whether the <i>java</i> executable is in the environment's path and the second command reports the version. If Java is not installed or the version is not at least 1.8, Java will need to be downloaded and installed in the current environment. Consult the local system administrator for installation of this software. For the do-it-yourself crowd, the Java software can be downloaded from the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/" target="_blank">Oracle Java Download</a> page. The suggested software package is the Java Standard Edition (SE) 8, either the JDK or the JRE package. The JDK package is not necessary to run the software but could be useful if development and compilation of Java software will also occur in the current environment.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
<h3><a name="Data_Dictionary_Requirement"></a>Data Dictionary Requirement</h3>
        
<p>Release <i>1r64</i> or later of the Planetary Science Data Dictionary (PSDD) is required for the tool to function properly. Release <i>1r66</i> of the PSDD supports the validation of explicit FILE objects. The latest version of the PDS data dictionary can be retrieved from the <a class="externalLink" href="http://pds.nasa.gov/tools/dictionary.shtml" target="_blank">PDS Data Dictionary</a> web page.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
<h3><a name="PDS4_Services"></a>PDS4 Services</h3>
        
<p>In order to perform the ingestion function, the Catalog Tool requires installation of and access to the Storage, Product and Registry Services. See their respective Installation documents for details on installing these services in the target environment.
        </p>
      </section>

    <section>
<h2><a name="Unpacking_the_Package"></a>Unpacking the Package</h2>
      
<p>Download the <i>catalog</i> package from the PDS <a class="externalLink" href="https://pds.nasa.gov/software/pds4/ingest/" target="_blank">FTP</a> site. The binary distribution is available in identical zip or tar/gzip packages. The installation directory may vary from environment to environment but in UNIX-based environments it is typical to install software packages in the <i>/usr/local</i> directory and in Windows-based environments it is typical to install software packages in the <i>C:\Program Files</i> directory. Unpack the selected binary distribution file with one of the following commands:
      </p>

      
<div class="source">
<pre>
% unzip catalog-2.2.0-bin.zip
or
% tar -xzvf catalog-2.2.0-bin.tar.gz
      </pre></div>

      
<p>Note: Depending on the platform, the native version of <i>tar</i> may produce an error when attempting to unpack the distribution file because many of the file paths are greater than 100 characters. If available, the GNU version of tar will resolve this problem. If that is not available or cannot be installed, the zipped package will work just fine in a UNIX environment.
      </p>

      
<p>The commands above result in the creation of the <i>catalog-2.2.0</i> directory with the following directory structure:
      </p>

      
<ul>
        
<li><b>README.txt</b><br />
          
<p>A README file directing the user to the available documentation for the project.
          </p>
        </li>
        
<li><b>LICENSE.txt</b><br />
          
<p>The copyright notice from the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">California Institute of Technology</a> detailing the restrictions regarding the use and distribution of this software. Although the license is strictly worded, the software has been classified as Technology and Software Publicly Available (TSPA) and is available for <i>anyone</i> to download and use.
          </p>
        </li>
        
<li><b>bin/</b><br />
          
<p>This directory contains batch and shell scripts for executing the tool.
          </p>
        </li>
        
<li><b>doc/</b><br />
          
<p>This directory contains a local web site with the Catalog Tool documentation, javadoc, unit test results and other configuration management related information. Just point your favorite browser to the <i>index.html</i> file in this directory.
          </p>
        </li>
        
<li><b>lib/</b><br />
          
<p>This directory contains the dependent jar files for the tool along with the executable jar file (catalog-2.2.0.jar) containing the Catalog Tool software.
          </p>
        
<li><b>keystore/</b><br />
          
<p>This directory contains the keystore file needed for Catalog to support product registration to a secured instance of the Registry Service.
          </p>
        </li>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
<h2><a name="Configuring_the_Tool"></a>Configuring the Tool</h2>
      
<p>By default, the Catalog Tool comes configured to access the Registry Service at the specific end point <i>http://localhost:8080/registry</i>. This should be modified to represent the end point of the Registry Service target installation. To change the end point, the <i>catalog</i> script should be modified as follows:
      </p>

      
<div class="source">
<pre>
${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java -Dpds.registry=&quot;http://localhost:8080/registry&quot; \
-Dpds.security.keystore=&quot;${KEYSTORE}&quot; -jar ${CATALOG_JAR} &quot;$@&quot;

  should be changed to (if hosted at node.nasa.gov on port 80):

${JAVA_HOME}/bin/java -Dpds.registry=&quot;http://node.nasa.gov/registry&quot; \
-Dpds.security.keystore=&quot;${KEYSTORE}&quot; -jar ${CATALOG_JAR} &quot;$@&quot;
      </pre></div>

      
<p>To change the end point for Windows, the <i>catalog.bat</i> script should be modified as follows:
      </p>

      
<div class="source">
<pre>
&quot;%JAVA_HOME%&quot;\bin\java -Dpds.registry=&quot;http://localhost:8080/registry&quot; \
-Dpds.security.keystore=&quot;%KEYSTORE%&quot; -jar &quot;%CATALOG_JAR%&quot; %*

  should be changed to (if hosted at node.nasa.gov on port 80):

&quot;%JAVA_HOME%&quot;\bin\java -Dpds.registry=&quot;http://node.nasa.gov/registry&quot; \
-Dpds.security.keystore=&quot;%KEYSTORE%&quot; -jar &quot;%CATALOG_JAR%&quot; %*
      </pre></div>

      
<p>The examples above have been broken into multiple lines for readability. The commands should be reassembled into a single line.
      </p>
      
      <section>
<h3><a name="Configuring_for_a_Secured_Instance_of_the_Registry_Service"></a>Configuring for a Secured Instance of the Registry Service</h3>
        
<p>By default, the Registry Service installation is not a secured instance. If specific steps have been taken to secure the local installation, then the following procedure should be completed in order to allow the Catalog Tool to access the Registry Service.
        </p>

        
<p>In order for the Catalog Tool to access a secured instance of the Registry Service, a keystore file must first be generated. Follow the instructions in the PDS Security Service Installation Guide on how to generate this keystore file. Once this is generated, copy the keystore file to the <i>keystore/</i> directory of the <i>Catalog</i> package and rename the file to <i>tomcat_self_sign_keystore</i> as this is what the Catalog shell script and batch file look for by default.</p>

<h2><a name="Configuring_the_Environment"></a>Configuring the Environment</h2>
      
<p>In order to execute the Catalog Tool, the local environment must first be configured appropriately. This section describes how to setup the user environment on UNIX-based and Windows machines.
      </p>

      <section>
<h3><a name="UNIX-Based_Environment"></a>UNIX-Based Environment</h3>
        
<p>This section details the environment setup for UNIX-based machines. The binary distribution includes a couple shell scripts that must be executed from the command-line. Setting the <i>PATH</i> environment variable to the location of the scripts, enables the shell scripts to be executed from any location on the local machine.
        </p>

        
<p>The following command demonstrates how to set the <i>PATH</i> environment variable (in Bourne shell), by appending to its current setting:
        </p>

        
<div class="source">
<pre>
% export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/catalog-2.2.0/bin
        </pre></div>

        
<p>In addition, the shell scripts require that the <i>JAVA_HOME</i> environment variable be set to the appropriate location of the Java installation on the local machine. The following command demonstrates how to set the <i>JAVA_HOME</i> environment variable:
        </p>

        
<div class="source">
<pre>
% export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java/home
        </pre></div>

        
<p>The system administrator for the local machine may need to be consulted for this location. The path specified should have a <i>bin</i> sub-directory that contains the <i>java</i> executable. This variable may also be defined within the scripts. Edit the scripts (files without the .bat extension) and change the line in the example above to represent the local Java installation.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
<h3><a name="Windows_Environment"></a>Windows Environment</h3>
        
<p>This section details the environment setup for Windows machines. The binary distribution includes a couple batch scripts that must be executed from the command-line. Setting the <i>PATH</i> environment variable to the location of the files, enables the batch scripts to be executed from any location on the local machine.
        </p>

        
<p>The following command demonstrates how to set the <i>PATH</i> environment variable, by appending to its current setting:
        </p>

        
<div class="source">
<pre>
C:\&gt; set PATH = %PATH%;C:\Program Files\catalog-2.2.0\bin
        </pre></div>

        
<p>In addition, the batch scripts require that the <i>JAVA_HOME</i> environment variable be set to the appropriate location of the Java installation on the local machine. The following command demonstrates how to set the <i>JAVA_HOME</i> environment variable:
        </p>

        
<div class="source">
<pre>
C:\&gt; set JAVA_HOME = C:\path\to\java\home
        </pre></div>

        
<p>The system administrator for the local machine may need to be consulted for this location. The path specified should have a <i>bin</i> sub-directory that contains the <i>java</i> executable. This variable may also be defined within the scripts. Edit the scripts (files with the .bat extension) and change the line in the example above to represent the local Java installation. Additional methods for setting Windows environment variables can be found in the <a href="index-win.html">Windows System Properties</a> document.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
<h3><a name="Installation_Location"></a>Installation Location</h3>
        
<p>Both the shell and batch scripts for this software utilize system commands for determining the installation home directory that may or may not be available on all platforms. If these commands are not available in the current environment, their use can be replaced in the scripts by setting the <i>PARENT_DIR</i> variable with the actual installation path. Modify the UNIX-based shell scripts as follows (the actual installation path may be different in the current environment):
        </p>

        
<div class="source">
<pre>
SCRIPT_DIR=`dirname $0`
PARENT_DIR=`cd ${SCRIPT_DIR}/.. &amp;&amp; pwd`

  should be replaced with:

PARENT_DIR=/usr/local/catalog-2.2.0
        </pre></div>

        
<p>Modify the Windows-based batch scripts as follows (the actual installation path may be different in the current environment):
        </p>

        
<div class="source">
<pre>
set SCRIPT_DIR=%~dps0
set PARENT_DIR=%SCRIPT_DIR%..

  should be replaced with:

set PARENT_DIR=C:\Program Files\catalog-2.2.0
        </pre></div>
